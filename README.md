# My Machine Learning & AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to my structured journey into the world of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This project serves as a living document of my progress, a portfolio of my hands-on work, and a practical application of the concepts taught in leading courses, inspired by the methodology of instructors like Andrew Ng.

The goal is not just to learn the theory, but to implement each concept in Python, building a strong, practical foundation in data science and machine learning engineering.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized into weekly modules, with each week focusing on a new core concept. Each module is self-contained in its own folder and includes:

-   A `README.md` file explaining the theoretical concepts learned during the week.
-   Python scripts (`.py`) with hands-on implementations of the algorithms.
-   Sample datasets (`data/`) used for training and testing the models.

### Learning Roadmap

-   **[Week 1: The Data Science Toolkit](./week1/)**
    -   **Concepts:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames & Series, Data Visualization.
    -   **Libraries:** `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`.
    -   **Skills:** Loading, inspecting, cleaning, and visualizing data to uncover initial insights.

-   **[Week 2: Supervised Learning & Linear Regression](./week2/)**
    -   **Concepts:** Supervised Learning fundamentals, the Train-Test Split methodology, Feature Scaling (`StandardScaler`), Simple and Multivariate Linear Regression.
    -   **Libraries:** `Scikit-learn`, `Seaborn`.
    -   **Skills:** Building predictive models for continuous values, evaluating model performance with R-squared and MSE, and interpreting model coefficients.

-   **[Week 3: Logistic Regression for Classification](./week3/)**
    -   **Concepts:** Classification fundamentals, the Sigmoid function, Decision Boundaries, handling missing & categorical data, interpreting a Confusion Matrix (Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
    -   **Libraries:** `Scikit-learn`.
    -   **Skills:** Building models for categorical outcomes (e.g., Yes/No), preparing real-world messy data, and using advanced metrics to evaluate classification performance.

-   **Upcoming Weeks...**
    -   Decision Trees & Random Forests
    -   Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
    -   Introduction to Neural Networks & Deep Learning with TensorFlow
